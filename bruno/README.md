# Description
This directory contains examples of how to use our APIs via Bruno (https://www.usebruno.com/), a Postman/Insomnia equivalent.

The scenarios presented give you a general (but not exhaustive) idea of the order in which you can play your calls, and allow you to experiment with them before integrating them into your application code.

The variables used in the calls are automatically filled in thanks to previous calls to adapt to your sandbox environment.

## Getting Started
### Create a Bruno environment
You'll need to create a bruno environment with the following information:

- clientId
- clientSecret
- clientToken
- graviteeApiKey

### Import the collection
